This project had us build our first simple cloud infrastructure.

To see our instructions see the [cloud-1.en.pdf](https://github.com/VR-Scott/cloud-1/blob/master/cloud-1.en.pdf).

I followed the following this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/php-hawordpress-tutorial.html) from AWS with some changes to fit with the pdf's instructions and used an AWS Educate.
